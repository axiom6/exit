- From Frisco comments: dashboard needs to focus less on speed of travel, more on distance away: ie: show how a trigger would be beneficial if it was 50 miles down hwy - that way suggesting a “no go” when people aren’t necessarily aware of the congestion on their trip ahead whereas the segment of congestion is already over-crowding the small business in that area.
- More Frisco comments: Show simple Predictive piece based on a weather forecast for planning a trigger (ie snowstorm, wet)
- Deals have to show control (ie max use) and show clear conversions.
- Reviews for deals? (the “SOcial” in “SO-MO-LO”) but has to be super simple due to time constraints
What technologies do you have in-use? MEAN stack, other?
